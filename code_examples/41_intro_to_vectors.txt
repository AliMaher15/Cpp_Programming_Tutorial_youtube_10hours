for array you either

int items[] = {12, 13}
or 
int items[20]

it has static value

for vector

std::vecotr<int> items;

called lists or array lists in other languages

can be 
std::vector<int> items={12, 13};
items.push_back(100); // add 100 to the vector
// it will re-allocate memory automatically

vectors actually know their size
items.size() // 3
// to get last element
items[items.size()-1]

the <int>
is like generic class to pass the type to a class
